# Spotify Family Manager 🎵

> *Because in the clurb we all family.*

Welcome to the digital enforcer of the Spotify Family Plan. This isn't just a payment tracker; it's a social experiment in friendship, financial responsibility, and the art of public shaming.

## What is this?

This is a **3D Carousel of Accountability**. It visualizes who in the squad is pulling their weight and who is treating the family plan like a charity.

## Features

- **The Carousel:** Spin through the faces of your "family" members. Admire their avatars. Judge their payment status.
- **Status Indicators:**
  - ✅ **Pay Now:** You are a golden child. May your playlists be ever fire.
  - ⏳ **Not Due:** Relax, it's not your month.
- **Payment Portal:** A modal that politely (but firmly) asks for money. It even calculates the amount due so you can't pretend you "didn't know."
- **Responsive Design:** Shaming works on mobile, tablet, and desktop. There is no escape.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the page:** Gaze upon the current month's billing cycle.
2.  **Navigate:** Use the arrows or swipe (yes, we got touch support) to find your face.
3.  **Pay Up:** If it's your month, the "Pay Now" button will be active. Click it.
4.  **Follow Instructions:** The modal will give you the bank details. Do the transfer. Don't make it weird.

## The Squad

*   **Amanda** 
*   **Marc-Anthony** 
*   **Keabetswe** 
*   **Gabrielle** 
*   **Sinethemba** 
*   **Bhekumuzi** 

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and "family" management purposes only. No actual friendships were harmed in the making of this payment manager (yet).
